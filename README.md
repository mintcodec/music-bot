## Usage

Invite your bot to your server with the `applications.commands` and `bot` scopes.

Use these slash commands in Discord:
- `/join` — Bot joins your voice channel
- `/leave` — Bot leaves the voice channel
- `/play <title or URL>` — Play a song by title or YouTube URL
- `/pause` — Pause playback
- `/resume` — Resume playback
